# Image_parallelization
This project demonstrates parallel processing of image tasks using a master-slave architecture. The master distributes tasks to slave processes, which execute edge detection, corner detection, and facial recognition on images. It dynamically adjusts the number of slaves based on CPU usage to optimize performance.
